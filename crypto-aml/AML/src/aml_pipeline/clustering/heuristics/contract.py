"""
Smart Contract Interaction Heuristic
======================================
Addresses that interact with the same smart contracts (DeFi apps, bridges,
or shared services) are grouped together.

Additionally detects Deposit → Contract → Withdraw cycles:
  addr_A  →  contract  →  addr_B
where addr_A and addr_B are linked because they use the same contract
as an intermediary.
